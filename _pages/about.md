I am a Computer Science graduate from Brac University. My research interests include Self-supervised Learning, Biologically Plausible Learning, Generative AI, and Machine Learning. I aim to discover how to achieve autonomous machine intelligence or machine common sense via inspiration from how the brain learns hierarchically and adapts to unseen situations with little data or supervision. Currently, I am working on several research projects including multi-level representation learning with H-JEPA, visibility estimation on foggy environments, machine unlearning in models trained with the forward-forward algorithm, and language modeling without softmax using VICReg and Barlow Twins. Apart from that, I love to stargaze and the smell of air after a drizzle.
