I am a Computer Science graduate from Brac University, currently working on several research projects, including multi-level representation learning with H-JEPA, language modeling without SoftMax using VICReg and Barlow Twins, and training convolutional spiking neural networks with the Forward-Forward algorithm objective, etc. My research interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Biologically Plausible Learning, and Self-supervised Representation Learning.  I aim to discover how to achieve autonomous machine intelligence or machine common sense via inspiration from how the brain learns hierarchically and adapts to unseen situations effectively with little data or supervision, including the practical applications of these systems with proper safety measures. Apart from that, I love to stargaze and the smell of the air after a drizzle.
